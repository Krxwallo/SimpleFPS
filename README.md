# Simple FPS

## About

Simple fps is a small clientside mod that shows the current debug fps at the top left of the screen. I couldn't find any simple only fps viewers online, so I decided to make one myself...

This mod is for people who don't want to get a big mod like optifine (has an option to view fps), but only want to have a nice little fps counter.
